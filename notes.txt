What is Git:
   - Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development.
   - Developed by Linus Torvalds, Git is widely used for managing and coordinating work among multiple contributors.

Importance of Git:
   - Enables collaboration among multiple developers on a project.
   - Tracks changes in code, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
   - Facilitates version control, allowing for the management of different versions of the software.

What is Branching:
   - Branching in Git involves creating separate lines of development to work on different features or bug fixes.
   - It allows developers to isolate changes, preventing interference with the main codebase until ready for integration.

What is Merging:
   - Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch (like master or main).

Types of Version Control:
   - Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
   - Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

Difference Between Distributed and Centralized VCS:
   - In a centralized VCS, the version control is managed on a central server.
   - In a distributed VCS like Git, every developer has a complete copy of the repository, providing more flexibility and redundancy.

Why Git is Required:
   - Git allows collaborative development.
   - Enables efficient version control.
   - Supports branching and merging.
   - Facilitates code review and collaboration.

What is a Repository:A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project's history and files are kept, often hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

Types of Repositories:
   - Public: Accessible by anyone.
   - Private: Limited access, typically for sensitive or proprietary projects.

Working Directory:The directory on your local machine where you're actively working on files.

Staging Area:An intermediate area where changes are marked for the next commit.

Commit History:A record of all commits made to the repository, showing changes, authors, and timestamps.

Origin Repository:The default name for the remote repository where your local repository was cloned from or will be pushed to.

Fork:In the context of GitHub, forking creates a personal copy of someone else's project, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original.

Difference Between Centralized and Distributed VCS:In centralized VCS, there is a single central repository. In distributed VCS, each user has a complete copy of the repository.

Difference Between Git and GitHub:Git is a version control system. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features.

Trunk-Based vs. Branch-Based Development:Trunk-based development involves frequent integration of code into the main branch. Branch-based development uses feature branches and merges them later.

Feature Toggle:A feature toggle is a mechanism to enable or disable a feature during runtime without changing the code. Useful for testing and gradual rollouts.

Scenario for Branch-Based and Trunk-Based Development: Branch-based is suitable for larger features or changes requiring long-term development. Trunk-based is suitable for smaller, more frequent changes.
